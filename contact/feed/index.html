					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back Brian and congratulations on spawning a life form. You did say you had a kid right? I can&#039;t remember oh, I know you definitely said something about why you were away. I&#039;m enjoying the new podcast and Trevor sounds enough like Colin that I can barely tell the difference especially as I listen at four times the speed on my podcast app. I have one very important question, and it&#039;s for Trevor, how do you feel about making lists? I&#039;m looking forward to having someone to send my film of the year top 326 list. One other thing how does Trevor feel about pictures of cats?
Keep up the good work, lots of love from your overseas listenership.]]></description>
