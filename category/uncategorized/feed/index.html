					<description><![CDATA[Excerpt---
The most obvious and probable reason Apple will be the parent company of Netflix sooner rather than later is money. Apple has a reportedly enormous amount of cash on hand.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Okay… I know it&#8217;s a clickbait title. But you really should understand what is happening behind the scenes. Disney&#8217;s acquisition of Fox and Hulu, along with its launch of ESPN+ and Disney+, has forced an industry shift. Cords are being cut faster than ever, and the streaming war is simmering to a boil. With this post, I&#8217;m going to show why I believe Apple will buy Netflix.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="http://giphygifs.s3.amazonaws.com/media/lZd4oyt1EzC3C/giphy.gif" alt="" width="591" height="311"/></figure></div>



<ol><li>Apple Has All The Cash</li></ol>



<p>The most obvious and probable reason Apple will be the parent company of Netflix sooner rather than later is money. Apple has a reportedly enormous amount of cash on hand. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" Some reports put the number at as much as $245 billion (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/29/apple-now-has-tk-cash-on-hand.html" target="_blank"> Some reports put the number at as much as $245 billion</a>. This amount means Apple could outbid almost every other competitor on the market. Netflix’s long-term debt at the end of the second quarter was over $12 billion, and that number keeps growing. Netflix&#8217;s business model has been to create as much content as possible and continue to grow its subscriber base. Unfortunately, Netflix&#8217;s subscriber base went backwards for the first time since 2011. The price for Netflix is going the wrong way, so now is the time to sell. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/26BkMImYAw9DmNjHi/giphy.gif" alt="" width="598" height="269"/></figure></div>



<p>   2. Apple TV+ Isn&#8217;t The Answer</p>



<p>Apple TV+ is set to launch in about a month for the low low price of $4.99 a month, but what we’ve seen isn’t that impressive. The reports are all over the place about how much Apple is going to spend on original content. The only concrete number we know for sure is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="$1 billion (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/16/16155600/apple-original-tv-content-1-billion-investment" target="_blank">$1 billion</a>. Apple has been producing original content since 2016, but with the launch of its own streaming platform, it needs a heavier investment. The flagship content is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="&quot;The Morning Show&quot; (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7203552/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_4" target="_blank">&#8220;The Morning Show&#8221;</a> starring Steve Carrell, Reese Witherspoon, and Jennifer Aniston. They’ve hooked other big names too like Oprah and Steven Spielberg, but they lack what brought viewers to Netflix and that’s a proven show. Shows like the The Office, Friends, and Grey’s Anatomy have propelled Netflix. Without a sure-fire hit or the reliance on a proven property, Apple TV+ won&#8217;t be a contender even at the $5 a month mark.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/jUKldPpZHZClbMwA7R/giphy.gif" alt="" width="594" height="334"/></figure></div>



<p> 3. Apple Needs A Win</p>



<p>Apple has always been an innovator and has given us amazing tech and software. They created an entire content platform with their podcast app. But over the last few years, we&#8217;ve seen them begin to sputter. They acquired Beats for $3.2 billion and immediately were immersed in a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="court battle with Bose (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apples-beats-bose-settle-patent-spat-over-noise-canceling-tech/" target="_blank">court battle with Bose</a>. Apple Music boasts 2 million more paid subscribers than Spotify but doesn&#8217;t come <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="close to the overall users (opens in a new tab)" href="https://pitchfork.com/news/apple-music-now-has-more-paid-us-subscribers-than-spotify-report/" target="_blank">close to the overall users</a>. Lastly, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="critics have continually killed Apple TV (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/apple-tv-4k,review-4693.html" target="_blank">critics have continually killed Apple TV</a>. (Not the streaming service but the actual hardware.) So Apple can&#8217;t afford to let Apple TV+ fail. Any sign that this won&#8217;t be a success and Apple will make a move because they can&#8217;t afford to let a competitor like Microsoft, Amazon, or Google swoop in. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3oz8xLrKEjbAbaqUxO/giphy.gif" alt="" width="432" height="520"/></figure></div>



<p>The bottom line is someone will eventually buy Netflix. Content companies like Netflix don&#8217;t stay independent especially when they rack up this amount of debt. It&#8217;s hard to fathom a world where Tim Cook and the board of Apple let this easy win pass them by.  Even J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee agrees. In a recent article, he said, &#8220;We believe Apple can drive synergies between its leading position in smartphones and the rapid transition of video consumption to mobile to drive stronger services growth.” Chatterjee also said, “We find Netflix as the best strategic fit, although we appreciate the  combination is less likely as Netflix is unlikely to be a seller for a modest premium.&#8221; Chatterjee‘s concern over price is justified, but the Netflix stock has been in a tailspin, and the cluttered streaming landscape isn’t helping. By 2022, I believe Apple will own Netflix!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p style="text-align:center">&#8220;Life is like a movie. You just can&#8217;t pick your genre.&#8221;</p>



<p style="text-align:center">-Billy (Scream)</p>



<p>For almost 25 years, the genre of teen films was a huge Hollywood cash cow. Studios took unknown actors and TV stars and placed them in small budget films. The strength of the scripts along with some great young actors propelled this genre into the forefront. So what happened? Why in modern cinema are teen films&nbsp;like The Duff so rare? Did Hollywood run the well dry? I think it has more to do with Hollywood than the lack of ideas, but let&#8217;s indulge in a little history first.</p>



<p>In the summer of 1982, Fast Times at Ridgemont High&nbsp;was given a limited theatrical release. By the time the film finished its theatrical run, it had made over 5x its budget. This, in my opinion, was the real beginning of the modern teen film. In some ways, Fast Times could be considered the precedent for every teen film released after it. It tackled everything from school and work, to&nbsp;home life. It put the magnifying glass on&nbsp;dating and even abortion. It had a great young cast and some very unforgettable scenes.</p>



<p>Over the next few years,&nbsp;the genre would grapple with which theme it wanted to lay claim to. Risky Business was gritty and funny. It launched Tom Cruise into stardom and proved teen films could gain critical acclaim. The following year, more accessible teen films were released. Sixteen Candles and Revenge of the Nerds were huge box office hits. The softer more palatable teen flicks were beginning to take hold later that year. But what really broke the mold was&nbsp;The Karate Kid,&nbsp;which&nbsp;raked in $90 million and spawned several sequels. It was clear heading into the second half of the decade that lighter teen films were a safe bet. Films like The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller&#8217;s Day Off, Weird Science, Pretty in Pink, Can&#8217;t Buy Me Love, Say Anything, and Bill &amp; Ted&#8217;s Excellent Adventure pulled in the cash for studios.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/TLbNQiRLeEiUE/giphy.gif" alt="" width="406" height="314"/></figure></div>



<p>But these weren&#8217;t the only teen films pouring in dollars. The teen horror genre also exploded. In 1984, A Nightmare on Elm Street started a cascade of teen horror films. The genre had been popular previously, but it was sporadic. Now sequels to Halloween and Friday the 13th were even more lucrative. In 1985, Fright Night was released to critical approval and commercial success. Fright Night was the second highest-grossing horror film of 1985, second only to the sequel of A&nbsp;Nightmare on Elm Street. The success of teen horror didn&#8217;t slow down with huge returns from The Lost Boys and Gremlins.</p>



<p>While the &#8217;80s struggled with finding its specific niche, the &#8217;90s went all-out fun and gore. The 1990s perfected the art of making a film about teens. Comedies and horror films filled the cinemas during the decade.&nbsp;The hip-hop comedy&nbsp;House Party surprised audiences to the return of 10x its budget. It was the first teen film released in the &#8217;90s and set the money machine in motion. Dazed and Confused and Don&#8217;t Tell Mom the Babysitter&#8217;s Dead were successful in their own ways. But their most important job was to warm up the box office for the quintessential teen film Clueless. Clueless owned the box office and critical praise based on the strength of Alicia Silverstone&#8217;s lead performance and the excellent script.</p>



<p>While Hollywood was finding gold in teen comedies, the teen horror genre seemed to be dead. Then in 1996, Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson teamed up to create an iconic teen slasher flick. Scream set the cinema on fire. The film was not only a critical success, but grabbed over $150 million at the box office. Over the next couple of years, teen horror would rule. I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend, The Faculty, and Halloween: H20 cornered the teen market.</p>



<p>With a very successful decade behind them already, Hollywood didn&#8217;t let up in 1999. Studios grasped the power of the teen market and unleashed a string of teen films unlike ever before. 1999 could be considered the golden year of teen films. 1999 began with the release of Varsity Blues and finished with Drive Me Crazy. Sandwiched in between were several hugely successful films. After the January release of Varsity Blues, She&#8217;s All That hit the theaters. January, which is typically considered a dead time for theaters, was booming. These films were two certified hits within 30 days. In fact, within the first four months of the year, teen films had accounted for roughly $400 million of the $2 billion in ticket sales. Because of movies like 10 Things I Hate About You, Go, Cruel Intentions, and Never Been Kissed, 13% of all money spent on ticket sales was going towards teen films.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="http://giphygifs.s3.amazonaws.com/media/CkmAH5qW9g8xi/giphy.gif" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>The teen genre&#8217;s attack on the &#8217;99 box office came to a massive end with American Pie. The film&nbsp;was given a summer release with insiders saying it could be a sleeper hit, and it was. American Pie grossed $235 million worldwide. In its first weekend, it beat a Will Smith film, an Adam Sandler film, and a Disney film. The comedy was a combination&nbsp;of gross-out humor, friendship, and a love for high school. It hearkened back to the beginning of the teen comedy. It had a far less social impact than Fast Times&nbsp;but was every bit as fun. The terrific soundtrack and unforgettable humor make American Pie possibly the greatest teen film of all time. It certainly was the most profitable.</p>



<p>Over the next few years, the fervor of teen films began to slow. 2000, 2001, and 2002 had a decent amount of success. Save the Last Dance, Road Trip, Bring It On, and Final Destination cleaned up at the box office, but Hollywood seemed to have moved on. There&nbsp;have been&nbsp;occasional hits like Mean Girls, Superbad, and Easy A. But the majority of teen films today are young adult&nbsp;novels or some other adaptation. The teen comedy or horror film is a thing of the past.</p>



<p>A recent successful teen film that wasn&#8217;t one of the Hunger Games or a John Green novel was The Duff. The Duff made $40 million on an $8 million budget. That return truly is impressive. The unfortunate problem facing teen films is the studio&#8217;s risk assessment. Getting a film financed in Hollywood is hard enough, even if you have big names attached. Now imagine pitching a film with no stars and no special effects.</p>



<p>With in the last four years, we&#8217;ve seen an uptick in teen films. The success has been sporadic. Films like Lady Bird, Eighth Grade, and Booksmart were critical darlings but didn&#8217;t kill the box office. Films like Love, Simon, and Everything, Everything did well at the box office. But perhaps the biggest success in this genre has been boosted by the MCU. The two recent Spider-Man movies were rooted in the classic John Hughes style of teen angst. I think this says a lot about where the genre is today and could go in the future if studios gave it another go.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6ZsZl5JPukSvVG80/giphy.gif" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>It is very disappointing that teenagers today will not be able to see an on-screen version of themselves because films like Fast Times, Clueless, and American Pie are time capsules. We go to movies to escape reality. As a teen, a film like Can&#8217;t Hardly Wait gave you the confidence to talk to that pretty girl, or The Breakfast Club revealed that no matter what background, a kid will always be a kid. Teen films are snapshots of a time and place. I love being able to grab American Pie, throw it in the DVD player, and be transported back to high school. Even as I wrote that last sentence, I realized that maybe I am like the teen film… a relic.</p>

<p>There are many different ways to use the web besides a mouse and a pair of eyes.  Users navigate for example with a keyboard only or with their voice. </p>



<p>All the functionality, including menus, links and forms should work using a <strong>keyboard only</strong>. This is essential for all assistive technology to work properly. The only way to test this, at the moment, is manually. The best time to test this is during development.</p>



<h3>How to keyboard test:</h3>
